    "In this example, the Car class defines the general state and behavior of a car. Instances of this class will have attributes like make, model, year, and speed, as well as methods like accelerate and brake to modify the state (speed) of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you're correct in saying that an object is an abstract state template describing the general state and behavior. It's like a template that defines what an entity of a certain type (a class) can do and what properties it possesses.\n",
